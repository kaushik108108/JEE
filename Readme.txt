The data is taken from Kaggle, data merging is done is Josaa_data_processing.ipynb file and I also attempted to apply ML model to it but accuracy wasn't good as of now.

The code given in jee_ranks.py contains a feature to import the dataset directly from my local postgres server.
The file is more than 25 MB, so I am giving a gdrive link for it:
